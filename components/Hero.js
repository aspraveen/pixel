          and I work as a Technical Consultant, Application Developer, and DevOps Engineer.
          <Box mt={5}>
            Since the year 2000 ("the dot-com era"), I have worked with a couple of companies to
            improve their web and e-commerce platforms. My main tech stack includes Python (Django),
            PHP (especially Laravel), MySQL, and Postgres. I have also worked with ASP.net and SQL
            Server for some projects. Additionally, I enjoy architecting and managing solutions on
            the cloud, especially AWS. In my current work, I mainly focus on ORACLE-based
            technologies.
          </Box>
          <Box mt={5}>
            In order to thrive in today's dynamic and constantly changing IT landscape, I try to
            experiment with new technologies whenever I get an opportunity. This has led the way to
            redevelop and migrate this website from WordPress to JAMstack (React.js, Next.js, Prima
            & Chakra UI). I am also exploring WEB 3.0 and Chat GPT-related technologies whenever I
            have some free time.
          </Box>
          <Box mt={5}>
            If I am not doing any IT related stuff, you can find me watching NETFLIX, browsing
            Twitter or Listening to Podcasts or music.
          </Box>
          <Box mt={5}>
